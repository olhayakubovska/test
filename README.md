# Tic-Tac-Toe 

This repository contains **three versions** of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game:  
1. **React only** — basic implementation with local component state.  
2. **React + Redux** — centralized state management using Redux.  
3. **React + Redux + Thunk** — same as version 2 but with `redux-thunk` middleware included.
